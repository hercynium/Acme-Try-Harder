=head1 NAME
 
C<Try::Harder> - Yet another pure-perl C<try/catch/finally> module

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
 use Try::Harder;
 
 # returns work as you would expect in other languages
 sub foo
 {
    try {
       attempt_a_thing();
       return "success"; # returns from the sub
    }
    catch {
       warn "It failed - $@";
       return "failure";
    }
 }
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides sane C<try/catch/finally> syntax for perl that is (mostly)
semantically compatible with the syntax plugin L<Syntax::Keyword::Try>, but
implemented in pure-perl using source filters. However, if you already have
L<Syntax::Keyword::Try> installed it uses that instead.

Please see the L<Syntax::Keyword::Try> documentation for usage and such.

=head1 RATIONALE

Sometimes you don't have a version of perl new enough to use
L<Syntax::Keyword::Try>, but really want its nice syntax. Or
perhaps you really need your code to be pure-perl for various
reasons.

=head1 CAVEATS

This code implements a source filter, so all standard caveats with that apply.

=head1 TODO

Test with L<fatpack>

=head1 NOTES

See the post-filtered code by running this:

    TRY_HARDER_USE_PP=1 perl -c -Ilib -MFilter::ExtractSource test.pl > transformed.pl

This module tries very hard to not change the line-count of your code, so the
generated code is *very* dense.
